# Strategy Analysis Results

## Current Status - Important Note
**⚠️ The previously shown results were from simulated data for demonstration purposes only.**

To get actual performance metrics, we need to:

1. Complete the historical data collection from:
   - Kraken API
   - Binance API
   - Bybit API

2. Run full backtests with real market data for:
   - Last 4 years of price data
   - Historical funding rates
   - Actual trading volumes
   - Real spreads and slippage

3. Implement proper risk calculations using:
   - Real volatility metrics
   - Actual liquidation prices
   - Historical margin requirements

## Next Steps to Get Real Results

1. **Data Collection**
   ```python
   # Required data points
   - OHLCV data (1h timeframe minimum)
   - Funding rates history
   - Liquidation data
   - Trading volume
   - Order book depth
   ```

2. **Backtest Parameters**
   ```python
   # Key parameters to validate
   initial_capital = 10000
   timeframe = "2020-01-01 to 2024-03-01"
   assets = ["BTC/USD", "ETH/USD", "SOL/USD"]
   exchanges = ["Kraken", "Binance", "Bybit"]
   ```

3. **Risk Management Validation**
   - Implement actual exchange fees
   - Use real slippage models
   - Apply proper position sizing
   - Include all trading costs

## Strategy Configurations

These are the actual strategy configurations we'll test (not simulated):

1. **Volatility Adaptive Strategy**
   ```python
   {
       "max_leverage": 3,
       "max_position_pct": 0.6,
       "min_spread": "dynamic based on volatility",
       "risk_params": {
           "max_drawdown": 0.15,
           "vol_lookback": 24,
           "position_scaling": True,
           "funding_threshold": 0.01
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Hybrid Adaptive Strategy**
   ```python
   {
       "max_leverage": 3,
       "max_position_pct": 0.5,
       "min_spread": 0.002,
       "risk_params": {
           "max_drawdown": 0.15,
           "strategy_weights": {
               "mean_reversion": 0.4,
               "trend": 0.4,
               "breakout": 0.2
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Mean Reversion Heavy**
   ```python
   {
       "max_leverage": 2,
       "max_position_pct": 0.4,
       "min_spread": 0.003,
       "risk_params": {
           "max_drawdown": 0.10,
           "mean_reversion_threshold": 2.0,
           "holding_period": 12,
           "stop_loss": 0.05
       }
   }
   ```

## Required Data Sources
- Kraken API: Historical trades, funding rates
- Binance API: OHLCV data, liquidation feed
- Bybit API: Order book data, trading volumes

## Completion Timeline
1. Data Collection: 2-3 days
2. Backtesting: 2-3 days
3. Results Analysis: 1-2 days
4. Strategy Optimization: 2-3 days

Once we have the actual data and complete the backtests, this document will be updated with real performance metrics and analysis.
