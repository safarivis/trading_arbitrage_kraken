# Binance Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks our attempts to integrate with Binance's Testnet API for our trading bot.

## Connection Attempts

### Initial Setup
- Created BinanceHandler class for managing trading operations
- Implemented with testnet support
- Added API key and secret configuration

### Connection Issues Encountered

#### Attempt 1: Direct Connection
```python
self.client = Client(api_key, api_secret, testnet=True)
```
**Result**: Failed with "No route to host" error
```
OSError: [Errno 113] No route to host
```

#### Attempt 2: Alternative Futures Testnet Endpoint
```python
self.client.API_URL = 'https://testnet.binancefuture.com/api'
```
**Result**: Failed with 404 error
```
{"timestamp":1733078271494,"status":404,"error":"Not Found","message":"No message available","path":"/api/v1/ping"}
```

#### Attempt 3: Standard Testnet Endpoint
```python
self.client.API_URL = 'https://testnet.binance.vision/api'
```
**Result**: Connection issues persisted

### Network Diagnostics

#### DNS Resolution
1. Local DNS (127.0.0.53):
   - Successfully resolves general domains (e.g., google.com)
   - Issues with Binance testnet domains

2. Google DNS (8.8.8.8):
   ```
   testnet.binance.vision IPs:
   - 52.85.24.47
   - 52.85.24.45
   - 52.85.24.125
   - 52.85.24.89
   ```

#### Direct IP Connection Attempt
- Attempted direct connection to IP with SSL:
  ```bash
  curl -v -H "Host: testnet.binance.vision" https://52.85.24.47/api/v3/ping
  ```
- Result: SSL/TLS handshake failure

### Identified Issues
1. Network Connectivity:
   - No route to host errors
   - Possible firewall or routing issues
   - Potential VPN interference

2. SSL/TLS:
   - Handshake failures
   - Certificate verification issues

3. DNS Resolution:
   - Inconsistent IP resolution
   - Possible DNS blocking

## Current Solution Attempts

### Proxy Implementation
```python
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=',
    'https': 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url='
}

self.client.session.proxies = proxies
self.client.API_URL = 'https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=https://testnet.binance.vision/api'
```

## Next Steps

### Potential Solutions to Try
1. Use a VPN service to bypass network restrictions
2. Implement alternative proxy solutions
3. Try different Binance API endpoints
4. Consider using Binance's WebSocket API instead of REST

### Required Information for Support
If contacting Binance support:
1. Network configuration
2. Error logs
3. DNS resolution results
4. Curl test results
5. SSL certificate verification status

## Dependencies
- python-binance
- requests
- Required Python packages in virtual environment

## Environment Setup
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate.fish  # For fish shell
pip install python-binance fastapi uvicorn requests
```
