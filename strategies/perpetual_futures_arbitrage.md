## Strategy Basics

### Core Concept
The strategy involves simultaneously:
1. Taking a position in the spot market
2. Taking an opposite position in the perpetual futures market
3. Collecting funding payments while maintaining delta-neutral exposure

### Example
```
Spot Market: BTC/USD at $95,000
Futures Market: BTC-PERP at $95,100
Funding Rate: 0.01% every 8 hours

Trade Setup:
- Buy 0.1 BTC on spot market
- Short 0.1 BTC on perpetual futures
- Collect funding payments every 8 hours
```

## Why It Works

### Market Structure
1. **Perpetual Futures Design**
   - Perpetual futures never expire
   - Need mechanism to track spot price
   - Funding rate serves as this mechanism

2. **Institutional Demand**
   - Large traders need futures for hedging
   - Willing to pay funding for position maintenance
   - Creates persistent market inefficiency

3. **Supply and Demand**
   - Leverage seekers create consistent demand
   - Hedgers maintain large positions
   - Results in predictable funding patterns

## Requirements

### Minimum Capital
1. **Absolute Minimum**: $500
   - Not recommended
   - Limited profit potential
   - High risk relative to reward

2. **Recommended Minimum**: $1,000
   - Position size: $5,000 (with 5x leverage)
   - Daily potential: $6.50 (0.65%)
   - Monthly potential: ~$195

3. **Optimal Setup**: $2,000+
   - Better risk management
   - More meaningful returns
   - Room for position scaling

### Technical Requirements
1. **Exchange Accounts**
   - Spot trading enabled
   - Futures trading enabled
   - API access configured

2. **Infrastructure**
   - Reliable internet connection
   - Automated monitoring system
   - Position management tools

## Implementation

### Step-by-Step Setup
1. **Market Analysis**
   ```python
   # Check conditions
   spot_price = get_spot_price()
   perp_price = get_perp_price()
   funding_rate = get_funding_rate()
   
   # Calculate metrics
   price_difference = (perp_price - spot_price) / spot_price
   daily_funding = funding_rate * 3  # 3 payments per day
   total_return = price_difference + daily_funding
   ```

2. **Position Sizing**
   ```python
   def calculate_position_size(capital, leverage=5):
       max_position = capital * leverage
       recommended_position = max_position * 0.8  # 20% buffer
       return recommended_position
   ```

3. **Entry Execution**
   - Place spot order first (less slippage)
   - Place futures order immediately after
   - Confirm both orders filled
   - Monitor position delta

### Profit Sources
1. **Funding Payments**
   - Primary source of profit
   - Paid every 8 hours
   - Usually 0.01% to 0.03% per payment

2. **Price Convergence**
   - Secondary profit source
   - Capture price differences
   - Usually 0.1% to 0.3% per trade

## Risk Management

### Position Management
1. **Stop Losses**
   - Set at 2% of capital per trade
   - Monitor spread widening
   - Watch funding rate changes

2. **Position Sizing**
   ```python
   max_position_size = capital * leverage
   actual_position = max_position_size * 0.8
   emergency_buffer = capital * 0.2
   ```

3. **Risk Limits**
   - Maximum leverage: 5x
   - Position buffer: 20%
   - Daily stop loss: 2%

### Common Risks
1. **Market Risks**
   - Spread widening
   - Funding rate changes
   - Market volatility
